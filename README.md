#Design Specification 
#Operating Frequency: 
• Central Frequency: 28 GHz 
• Frequency Range: 20 GHz (Min Frequency) to 40 GHz (Max Frequency) 
#Substrate: 
RT/duroid 5880 laminates has a low dielectric constant (Dk) and low dielectric loss, making them 
well suited for high frequency/broadband applications. Helping to maintain the Dk uniformity are 
the randomly oriented microfibers reinforcing the PTFE composites.
